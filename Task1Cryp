# Cryptography
# Concept
  Learn the difference between:
      Symmetric Encryption (AES, DES) - Uses the same key for encryption & decryption.
      Asymmetric Encryption (RSA, Diffie-Hellman) - Uses public & private keys.
      Hashing (SHA-256, MD5) - One-way function to verify data integrity.
      PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) - Manages digital certificates for secure communication.
      TLS/SSL - Secures web connections (HTTPS).

# Study Historical Ciphers
  Caesar Cipher (Shift cipher):
      Encrypts by shifting letters (e.g., A → D, B → E with key=3).
      Weakness: Only 25 possible keys → Easy to brute-force.

  Substitution Cipher:
      Replaces each letter with another (e.g., A → X, B → P).
      Weakness: Vulnerable to frequency analysis (e.g., 'E' is the most common letter in English).

  Transposition Cipher:
      Rearranges letters (e.g., writing in columns, then reading in rows).
      Weakness: Structure can be detected with pattern analysis.

# Practice Decrypting Caesar Cipher
  Given an encrypted message:
    "YMNX NX FQUMF GWFAT HTSYFHYNSL YFSLT MTYJQ RNPJ"
    
  Brute-force approach: Try all 25 possible shifts.
    Solution: Shift by 5 →
    "THIS IS ALPHA BRAVO CONTACTING TANGO HOTEL MIKE"

  Encrypted Quote:
    "Xjnvw lc sluxjmw jsqm wjpmcqbg jg wqcxqmnvw; xjzjmmjd lc wjpm sluxjmw jsqm bqccqm zqy." Zlwvzjxj Zpcvcol
  How to Solve?
    Recognize it’s a Caesar Cipher (shift-based).
    Use brute-force or frequency analysis.
    Find the correct shift (likely 21 or 5).
    Decrypt to get the original quote.
    Answer: The quote is by Miyamoto Musashi (Option A).

  Key Takeaways
    Old ciphers (Caesar, substitution) are insecure → Modern cryptography uses complex math (AES, RSA).
    Brute-force attacks work on weak keys (e.g., Caesar’s 25 keys vs. AES-256’s ~2²⁵⁶ keys).
    Frequency analysis breaks substitution ciphers by analyzing letter patterns.
